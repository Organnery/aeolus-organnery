# Aeolus

Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator by Fons 
Adriaensen. It is a software synthesiser optimised for this job, with 
potentially hundreds of controls for each stop that enable the organist to 
"voice" their instrument.

Main features of the default instrument are: three manuals and one pedal, 
eleven different temperaments, variable tuning, MIDI control of course, stereo, 
surround or Ambisonics output, and flexible audio controls including a large 
church reverb.

Aeolus is not very CPU-hungry, and should run without problems on a 1GHz CPU 
with 256MB RAM.
